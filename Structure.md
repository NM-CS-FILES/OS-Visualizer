## Locality:
 - Caching L1-l3
 - Mapping
    - Buckets
    - Hashing
---
## File System
 - B tree
 - Translate to a file system 
---
## Paralellism 
 - implement a large vector
 - Split large vector into multiple smaller vectors
 - have them run operations at the same time on each vector
 - merge vector back into large vector when done
